চন্দ্রবিন্দু
======
A bare minimum collection of statements to parse and execute _programs_ written 
in the  beautiful language of Bengali, such that it just slightly smooches the 
definition of a programming language.

For now, it just runs one program correctly, but it should have no trouble 
executing very simple programs based on if-else and while statements.

It supports very basic set of mathematical operations, comparisons, and 
equality testing. It only has two datatypes, integer and string, and you can 
really manipulate only integers for now. Strings are constant, and can only 
be used for display. Speaking of which, it also has a built in 'print' call.

Oh, and did I mention it was written in 3 hours on a gloomy day? You're welcome.
